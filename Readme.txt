Project was built with Visual Studio Express 2015.

There are 2 external dependencies referenced in the project. They should run OK on other computers, but just incase there is a problem when running software you will need to read the IKVM.OpenJDK.Core.dll.

This can be found by download https://sourceforge.net/projects/ikvm/files/latest/download?source=files

Add the IKVM.OpenJDK.Core.dll to the project references. It is located in the bin folder in IKVM.

Also, please open all Excel documents located in Resources\Excel and take them out of protected mode. Then save the documents. 

If you can't get the software to run, you can either watch the video we made, or email wwhite3@my.lamar.edu for assistance.
